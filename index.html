<h1>About Me:</h1>
<div class="line"></div>
<p>Timothy Berners-Lee was born in London, England. His mathematician parents,
    who had worked on the revolutionary Mark I computer, frequently discussed mathematics at home,
     and encouraged Timothy’s scientific interests. From an early age, he was fascinated by both mathematics
      and electronics. As a schoolboy, he closely followed the emerging field of transistor technology
       and built electronic devices to control his model trains.
       As a physics student at Oxford, Berners-Lee continued to tinker with electronic devices.
        In his spare time, he painstakingly soldered together his own computer terminal from a discarded
         calculator, broken television sets and a car battery. His unauthorized use of the nuclear physics
          laboratory’s mainframe led to his being barred from the system. He had already begun devising
           his own computer languages, and after graduating with a degree in physics in 1976, he found
            his services as a computer programmer in immediate demand.
